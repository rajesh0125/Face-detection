# Face-detection
This AI Face Detection System is a real-time face recognition application built with Python, OpenCV, and Flask. It allows users to register faces, train a recognition model, and detect faces in live video streams through a user-friendly web interface.
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a real-time face detection and recognition system built with:

OpenCV (for face detection & recognition)

Flask (for the web interface)

Haar Cascade & LBPH (for face detection & training)

It allows users to:
âœ… Register new faces (collect dataset)
âœ… Train a custom face recognizer
âœ… Detect & recognize faces in real-time via a web interface

âœ¨ Features
âœ” Live Face Detection â€“ Uses Haar Cascade to detect faces in real-time.
âœ” Face Recognition â€“ Identifies registered users with LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram).
âœ” Web Interface â€“ Built with Flask for easy interaction.
âœ” Responsive UI â€“ Works on both desktop and mobile.
âœ” Background Image Support â€“ Customizable UI with dynamic background.

ðŸš€ How It Works
Data Collection (project.ipynb)

Captures face samples from the webcam (cv2.VideoCapture).

Saves cropped faces in data/ (e.g., user.1.1.jpg).

Model Training (project.ipynb)

Uses LBPH Face Recognizer to train on collected images.

Saves the trained model as classifier.xml.

Real-Time Detection (app.py)

Flask streams live video with face detection & recognition.

Recognized faces are labeled (e.g., "Rajesh" or "UNKNOWN").

Web Interface (index.html)

Start/Stop buttons to control the video feed.

Smooth animations & responsive design.
